# Data folder

This folder contains five folders named for each dataset.

## Dataset folders

`news/` `wikiann/` `twner/` `fbner/` `atisner/`

Each dataset folder includes four `txt` files employed during the experiments.

**Txt files:** `train_CONLL.txt` `test_CONLL.txt` `train_SENTENCED.txt` `test_SENTENCED.txt`

> Since we are not the curators of the datasets used in this study, we are not able to share them without permission; therefore, we added template txt files in the dataset folders in order to show the dataset file formats for the experimental process. In order to obtain the datasets, you can ask to original dataset curators cited in the dataset folders.
