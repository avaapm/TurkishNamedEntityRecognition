# Data folder contains five folders for each dataset

Dataset folders: news, wikiann, twner, fbner, and atisner

## Each dataset folder includes four txt files

Txt files: train_CONLL.txt, test_CONLL.txt, train_SENTENCED.txt, and test_SENTENCED.txt

We are not able to share the datasets; therefore, we added template txt files in the dataset folders in order to show the dataset files' formats for the experimental process.
