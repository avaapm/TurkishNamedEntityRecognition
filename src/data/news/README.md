> We accessed this dataset by asking to original dataset curators. You can also access this dataset via [Turkish Data Depository](https://data.tdd.ai/#/effafb5f-ebfc-4e5c-9a63-4f709ec1a135). However, we use the version from the paper [An evaluation of recent neural sequence tagging models in Turkish named entity recognition](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115049).
